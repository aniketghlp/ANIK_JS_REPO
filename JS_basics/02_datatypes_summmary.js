// primitive ds vs non-primitive  --- how data is stored in memory and how it is accessed
/* Primitive - Call by value not address (copied and used)
String , Number , Boolean , null ,undefined, Symbol( makes a value uniique) , Bigint  
*/
/* Refrence type (non-primitive) -- Call by refrence  (address) 
Array , Object , functions

//JS  is dynamic typed language for example we donot need to define variable type 
// const number = 11  we donot need to define const number = int(11) or float(11) hence it is a dynamic language.
